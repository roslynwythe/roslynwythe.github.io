title: LA TDM Calculator
description: The LA TDM Calculator is a web app, created in conjunction with the L.A. Department of Transportation (LADOT) and Los Angeles City Planning, to help real estate developers design better projects for Los Angeles. The Calculator is being implemented alongside a new ordinance reducing over-parking and improving the infrastructure to incentivize public transportation and discourage single occupancy vehicle trips.
