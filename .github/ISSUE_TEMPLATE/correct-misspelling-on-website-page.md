### Overview
Our website needs to be free of misspellings so that our reputation for quality is maintained.  In this issue a misspelling in the [REPLACE WITH WHERE]  on the [REPLACE WITH NAME OF PAGE] page will be corrected.  

### Action Items
- [ ] For the file `[REPLACE WITH DIRECTORY & NAME OF FILE (e.g., /pages/communities-of-practice.html)]`, correct the spelling from "[REPLACE WITH MISSPELLED WORD]" to "[REPLACE WITH CORRECT SPELLED WORD]", so
   ```
   [REPLACE WITH CURRENT CODE]
   ```
   becomes
   ```
   [REPLACE WITH FUTURE CODE - WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER ITS FIXED]
   ```
- [ ] Use Docker to test changes locally, in both desktop and mobile views
